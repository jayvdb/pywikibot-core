# This is a PIP requirements file
#
# All dependencies can be installed using:
# $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# It is organised so that simple requirements
# are processed first, and more difficult packages
# are last.
# All dependencies other than  httplib2 are optional.
#
# It is good practise to install packages using the system
# package manager if it has a packaged version.  If you are
# unsure, please use pip as described at the top of the file.
#
# To get a list of potential matches, use
#
# $ awk -F '[#>=]' '{print $1}' requirements.txt | xargs yum search
#     or
# $ awk -F '[#>=]' '{print $1}' requirements.txt | xargs apt-cache search

# mandatory; see README.conversion.txt

flickrapi
# On Python 2, flickrapi 1.4 or 2.x may be used.  On Python 3, it must be 2.x.
# The above automatically selects 2.x, which depends on requests 2.x, which
# may cause pip to report an error like the following...
# pkg_resources.VersionConflict: (requests 1.2.3 (/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('requests>=2.2.1'))
# If you see that on Python 2, change the above to flickrapi==1.4.5
# On Python 3, force pip to install requests 2.2.1, or remove flickrapi above.
